# GeoAPI

GeoAPI project provides a common framework based on OGC/ISO standards to improve interoperability among .NET GIS projects. GeoAPI is used mostly as a base for [NTS](https://github.com/NetTopologySuite/NetTopologySuite/)

### Supported platforms

GeoAPI supports a wide range of .NET versions:

- net20
- net35-client
- net35-cf
- net40-client
- net403-client
- net45
- netstandard1.0
- portable40-net40+sl5+win8+wp8+wpa81
- portable40-net403+sl5+win8+wp8+wpa81

### Development & building

Because of the wide support of platforms, building GeoAPI can be a pain. Make sure you install all the targeting packs. We provided a few scripts for this in the root folder of this repo.
